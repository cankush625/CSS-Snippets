# Tips for height

### If we want that the height should increase with the content then we can set `height: auto;`.
### When height is set to auto then it will take the height of the content. If no content then height is 0.
### If we set `height: 100%;` then it will take the height of the parent irrespective of the content.

### Try not to set the height. Set the height only if it is required. Setting height is dangerous.
### If you have to set height then prefer to set it using `min-height: 2em;`.
