# Making media queries work

### TO fix the broken media queries on mobile phones we need to add a meta tag to the HTML head
### Add this to html head: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width initial-scale=1">`
### Initial scale means the content at nornal position, not zoomed in nor zoomed out
### Never disable the zoom-in and zoom-out functionality.
